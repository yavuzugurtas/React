  // The config in create-react-app allows you for instance to already use optional chaining
  const result = optionalChaining({});

  // The implementation op the function above use optional chaining
  // Currently this is still a proposal https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining
  // Babel makes sure we can already use it by transpiling the code

  // This test is purely informative
