## Weekly Projects

The structure of a weekly projects is that of a [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). This is boilerplate, a set of tools and a predefined structure to start writing React fast.
The first project ([week-1-project](./week-1-project)) will teach you all about how it works.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

### Node

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
If not https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

### Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is a package manager. 
Similar to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). As this package manager is recommended by [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) we will use it throughout the exercises.

- Install yarn https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
- After yarn is installed navigate to the root of this project and run `yarn install`

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) will install the dependencies defined in [package.json](./package.json).

## Let's start

- Navigate to the a week directory (e.g. `week-1-project`) in your document explorer.
- Open the README.md file.
